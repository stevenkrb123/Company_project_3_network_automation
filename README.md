# Company_project_3_network_automation
PROJECT SCHEDULE
• How the project was split into tasks / phases: After being
consulted by Mr Janne, I decided dividing the project into several big tasks to
achieve automating the network system by using Python’s AsyncIO, Telnetlib
libraries, anf Napalm.

• Scheduling, effort estimation and actual working times of phases:
To complete this third company project part, I must at least achieve 200 working
hours, It took me 202 hours to complete this one.


EXPERIENCES OF THE TOOLS USED IN THE PROJECT
• Describe the tools which you have used in the project: I have used
GNS3, GNS3 VM, virtual box as a hypervisor to run GNS3 VM, Pycharm.
• Describe your experiences of the tools and would you use them
again and why / why not: GNS3 is one of the best network software emulators,
after using it for a while I just can not ask for more than of it. I’ve installed Virtual
Box and run a guest OS(GNS3 VM) on it and everything works properly, in this part of the project
I have install Napalm and AsyncIO libraries to work with network automation tasks.


PROJECT RESULTS
• Describe the results of the project – what was it that you did?
• If you developed some software for example describe its
features and how it works, you can also use screenshots to illustrate your
work: I’ve set up several network system importing IOU images (fully
working version of IOS of network devices) and run those on the GNS3 VM,
to conduct the network automation on those devices , I have developed
several Python scripts which are used to automatically push the
configuration (to a single device, to multiple devices, to multiple devices
from multiples config-files , and backup the running-config by creating .txt
backup files) to the system, managing the system’s operation, I have used AsyncIO
to implement concurrent applications which are used to solve several netowrk tasks.
• Analyze which requirements were fulfilled: The goal of
those company project courses is to improve my networking and programming
skills and learn the new things, which can help me a lot in my future’s career,
despite the difficulties that I had been through in this third part, I have learned
new things of Python, and dramatically improved my programming skills.
